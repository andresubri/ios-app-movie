# Movie App

Hey there  ðŸ‘‹ , **Movie App** is an iOS native app. Here you can navigate through most top rated movies and save them for further consultation.

## TODO

 - [x] List the movies as a grid.
 - [x]   The movie can be clickable and show the detail screen.
 - [ ]   The list can be sorted by :

	-   Movie name
	    
	-   Rating (default)
	    
	-   Publication year

 - [ ]   The detail screen should allow the user to save or remove the move from favorite, meaning if the movie is already saved in favorite you should show remove instead of add (change the button label base on that)
    
 - [ ]   The App should work offline(no connectivity)
    
 - [ ]   Use Firebase Analytics to track the name of the movie the user clicks
    
 - [ ]   Save and retrieve the moviedb API key using Firebase RemoteConfig
